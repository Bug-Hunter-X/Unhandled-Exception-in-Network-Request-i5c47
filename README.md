This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: improper handling of exceptions during asynchronous network requests. The `bug.dart` file showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.dart` provides a more robust solution.  The core problem is the lack of specific exception handling and informative error messages. The solution focuses on improving exception handling and providing better user feedback.
